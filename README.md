# Chef Llama

This a small fun using Huggingface Inference. Mistral AI\* is providing the user with a simple recipe based on the ingredients provided by the user.

\*If you are confused about the name of the app, I was thinking of using ollama at first. Ended up just using the name Llama cause I liked it

### Installation

`git clone https://github.com/redbillis/chef-llama.git`

`npm install`

Make sure to add your Access Token from hugginface to your .env file. Also please check ai.js for the name.

Finally run:

## Enjoy your food!
